## HYPE Agents 

Period: every 7 days 
Action: the most active UID is selected. Agent role is granted to the UID’s owner (wallet hash). 
Reward mechanism: with 100 weeks passed (100 reporting periods of 7 days) the Agent tokens are transferred to the Agents roles within the platform accounts and become available to claim directly to the wallet connected (Metamask, WalletConnect, etc.) based on wallets hashes. 
 
**Business-process! - the amount reported is the top active 7 days of the agent’s UID (7 top profit days were tracked in 100 weeks of the calculated period). Agents’ tokens are distributed equally to the number of buyers UID’s owner managed to engage (within the reported period).
